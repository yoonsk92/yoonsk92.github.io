## **Implementing DEA for ESG Efficiency: First step**
In the [previous article](https://optinbusiness.com/posts/ESG/), we discussed the growing importance of **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)** metrics, not only for businesses but also for countries. As we shift from merely understanding ESG factors to evaluating their efficiency, [Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)](https://optinbusiness.com/posts/DEA/) becomes a vital tool. With DEA, we can measure how well countries or organizations convert their resources (inputs) into positive ESG outcomes (outputs).

Now, we move into the practical application of DEA using real-world data. The goal is to assess the ESG performance of various countries by analyzing how efficiently they use resources like **energy**, **land**, and **water** to achieve outcomes such as **access to electricity**, **social equity**, and **environmental protection**.

### **Preparing for the Evaluation**
#### **1. Inputs and Outputs Selection**:
For the DEA model, we will use a selection of **inputs** (resource usage) and **outputs** (ESG performance outcomes) based on the data available from the [World Bank Group](https://www.worldbank.org/ext/en/home). The indicators are chosen to reflect core ESG dimensions, environmental sustainability, social progress, and governance efficiency.
- **Inputs**:
  - **Annual Freshwater Withdrawals (% of internal resources)**: Reflecting water resource consumption, a key environmental resource.
  - **Agricultural Land (% of land area)**: Representing the proportion of land used for agriculture, a measure of land resource consumption.
  - **Energy Use (kg of oil equivalent per capita)**: Reflecting the energy consumption of a country, linked to both environmental sustainability and social development.

- **Outputs**:
  - **Access to Electricity (% of population)**: Measuring social welfare through access to energy, a key aspect of development.
  - **Access to Clean Fuels for Cooking (% of population)**: An indicator of environmental and social progress, reflecting access to clean energy resources.
  - **Coastal Protection (% protected)**: Measuring efforts to protect vital environmental assets, linked to sustainability.
  - **Control of Corruption (Estimate)**: A key governance outcome, refelcting how effectively a country manages corruption.

#### **2. Optimistic Dataset Preparation**:
Some ESG indicators in the dataset come with **uncertainty bounds** or **plausible ranges**, meaning that the exact values are not always known. To handle this variability, we'll focus on the **optimistic scenario**, assuming the best possible outcomes. This involves:
- Using the **lower bounds** of the **inputs** (resources used).
- Using the **upper bounds** of the **outputs** (performance outcomes).

By doing so, we can evaluate how efficiently each country operates under the assumption that they are performing at their best potential within the given data range.

#### **3. What's Next?**:
In the **next article**, we will dive deeper into the **data preparation process**:
- How do we extract and organize the relevant ESG data?
- What steps are involved in cleaning the data and handling missing values?
- How do we structure the data for efficiency evaluation?
We will walk through these steps to ensure the dataset is ready for modeling. This preparation stage is essential for making sure our [Data Envelopment Analysis](https://optinbusiness.com/posts/DEA/) results accurately reflect the performance of each country.
